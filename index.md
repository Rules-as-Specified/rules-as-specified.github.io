Rules as Specified — A Manifesto
---

Playing board games and tabletop role-playing games often involves two common interpretive approaches:

- _Rules as Written_ (**RAW**): To follow the rules as they are written, but the wording itself may be ambiguous.
- _Rules as Intended_ (**RAI**): To follow the rules as they were meant, but the authors’ intentions may be unclear, and players may disagree on what they are.

We propose a third approach, _Rules as Specified_ (**RAS**), where each rule’s specification can be verified. In this model, the rule’s intention must be sound, while its written form illustrates but does not determine the rule.
